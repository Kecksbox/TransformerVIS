## Requirements

* Both Linux and Windows are supported.
* 64-bit Python 3.7 installation.
* TensorFlow 2.1, which we used for all experiments in the paper.
* One or more high-end NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA drivers, CUDA 10.0 toolkit and cuDNN 7.5. To reproduce the results reported in the paper, you need an NVIDIA GPU with at least 12 GB of DRAM.

## Examples
